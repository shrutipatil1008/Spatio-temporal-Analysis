#Spatio-Temporal Analysis

##Overview

This repository contains research and implementation for analyzing spatio-temporal data using cluster analysis and Explainable AI (XAI). The goal of this study is to identify hotspots in a given region using advanced clustering techniques and further interpret the clustering results with XAI methods.

Research Topic:
Analyzing Spatio-Temporal Data using Cluster Analysis and Interpreting with Explainable AI
ðŸ“… September 2023 â€“ Present

Progress So Far:
- Two-Phased Cluster Analysis: Applied clustering techniques to detect spatial-temporal hotspots in the dataset.
- CLAMP Approach: Utilized CLAMP (Cluster Analysis with Multidimensional Prototypes) methodology to derive meaningful insights.
- Comparative Analysis: Analyzed ride patterns from two different datasets and compared results.

Datasets Used:
- Kaggle Peru Uber Ride Dataset - Publicly available dataset containing Uber ride records in Peru.
- Real-World Spatio-Temporal Bus Ride Dataset - Dataset collected from the Bayern region of Germany, containing bus ride patterns over time.

Next Steps:
- Enhancing Cluster Interpretability: Develop and implement a structured approach to improve cluster interpretation using XAI techniques.
- Algorithm Evaluation: Experimenting with multiple clustering algorithms (e.g., ST-DBSCAN) to determine the most effective method for analyzing spatial and temporal ride patterns.
- Model Validation & Visualization: Validate clustering results through statistical measures and visualize patterns effectively using spatial tools.

Tools & Technologies Used:
QGIS - For geospatial visualization and analysis.
Python - Used for data processing, clustering, and model development.
Clustering Techniques - Applied ST-DBSCAN and other algorithms for spatio-temporal clustering.
Explainable AI (XAI) - Methods to interpret clustering results and understand feature contributions.
